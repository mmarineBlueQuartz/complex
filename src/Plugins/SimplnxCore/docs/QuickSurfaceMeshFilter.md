# Create Surface Mesh (QuickMesh)

## Group (Subgroup)

Surface Meshing (Generation)

## Deprecation Notice

The "SurfaceNets" filter should be used instead. Search the filter list for "Surface Nets".

## Description

This **Filter** generates a **Triangle Geometry** from a grid **Geometry** (either an **Image Geometry** or a **RectGrid Geometry**) that represents a surface mesh of the present **Features**. The algorithm proceeds by creating a pair of **Triangles** for each face of the **Cell** where the neighboring **Cells** have a different **Feature** Id value. The meshing operation is extremely quick but can result in a surface mesh that is very "stair stepped". The user is encouraged to use a smoothing operation to reduce this "blockiness".

The user may choose any number of **Cell Attribute Arrays** to transfer to the created **Triangle Geometry**. The **Faces** will gain the values of the **Cells** from which they were created.  Currently, the **Filter** disallows the transferring of data that has a *multi-dimensional* component dimensions vector.  For example, scalar values and vector values are allowed to be transferred, but N x M matrices cannot currently be transferred.

This filter will ensure that the smaller of the 2 **FaceLabel** values will always be in the first component (component[0]). This will allow assumptions made in downstream filters to continue to work correctly.

### Node Types

One of the arrays to come out of the algorithm is the "Node Type" vertex array. This array uses a value to label each vertex as to what kind of node it was determined to be during the meshing process.

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 2 | Node within the interior of the grain face.  |
| 3 | Node along a triple line  |
| 4 | Node that is a Quadruple point  |
| 12 | Node that is on the exterior of the mesh  |
| 13 | Node that is on the exterior of the mesh and is a triple line  |
| 14 | Node that is on the exterior of the mesh and is a quadruple point   |

## Notes

The Quickmesh algorithm is very crude and naive in its implementation. This filter 
along with the Laplacian Smoothing filter can give you reasonable results. The
newer filter that should replace both the quick mesh and the Laplacian Smoothing
filter is the "SurfaceNets" surface meshing algorithm. This will create the surface
mesh and smooth in a single filter and give subjectively better results.
