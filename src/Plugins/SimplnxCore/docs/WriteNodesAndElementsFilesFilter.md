# Write Nodes and Elements File(s)

## Group (Subgroup)

IO (Output)

## Description

This **Filter** exports geometric data into structured text files.  It allows users to save the following:

1. Node Data (Vertices): Export the coordinates of points that define the geometry.
2. Element Data (Connectivity): Export the node indices that make up the edges, faces, or volumes of the geometry.

The filter gives the user the option to export a node file, element file, or both.  It also allows the user to decide whether or not to number the nodes and elements and whether or not to include headers for the node and element files.
